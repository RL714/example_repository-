~ = represent the current user home folder 
cd - change directory 

ls = list items in directory

On windows, it is not case sensitive (but stick to lower case I'd advise, opposed to
Not caring)

clear - command to clear the Git Bash 

cd .. - command to return to home folder

cd (and where you want to go) i.e. - cd- onedrive 

.. = parents folder of folder (with cd though) cd .. 

Argument is additional information a command needs to work

ls does not need an arguement, but it can take an argument, -l  for example tells you
that you want it in a list format

/ = root file folder of the system

nano - gets you into text editor thing, hold control + indicated letter to exit or follow other commands

if you can change font in a program, it is not plain text, you're in a word editor
or rich text, not the place to write code

Generally do not use slash ^ be very careful. It can represent a different location 
and what you think 

Abosolute and relative file paths

Absolute file paths always start with a slash
It says they should start from the very first file in the drive

95% of the time in this class we won't use /

A relative on the other hand will look in the relative file 

Multiple words = multiple arguments, so you must use quotation marks to unify the argument on cd 

~  = home folder directory
mkdir+name = create a folder
nano = access to txt file

git init = initialize 

^ you got to be careful where you run this command as this command will convert the current folder into 
a repository 
Don't run it in docs, you don't want a repository in another repository 

(Master)
says you are in a repository ls

ls -a 
Do not use willy nily can cause data loss
Do not mess with it. It can break repository and destroy backup. Do not use git as a backup tool
just because it has history 
.. - Parent rolder (A special folder in every folder in existence. It is just normally hidden from you.) 
Documents would be the folder in the case of example_repository folder
.= Folder itself - If you were the folder, you would be looking in the mirror

I SHOULD HAVE BACKUPS FOR THIS CLASS
